TXV

TXV is part of the TX Modular System - open source audio-visual software for modular synthesis and video generation.

TX Modular comes is 2 parts: the main TX Modular system and audio engine are built with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io).

TXV, the visual engine, is a separate app built with [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc) that connects to the TX Modular System.

There are TXV builds for  MacOS and Windows.
The TXV build for MacOS will only work with Mojave (10.14) or earlier (10.11, 10.12 & 10.13) - but NOT Catalina (10.15) or later.

Building TXV with openFrameworks on Linux or MacOS Catalina (10.15) is currently untested.
